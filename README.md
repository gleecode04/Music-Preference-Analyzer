# Spotify Wrapped

Share, browse, and discuss Spotify Wrapped—without the DM chaos. This Android app lets you securely connect your Spotify account, generate your personal Wrapped-style summary, and instantly share it to a social feed where friends can like and comment.

> “At the end of the year, many Spotify users get their annual *Wrapped*… Traditionally, you would have to screenshot or send a link of your wrapped to each person individually — a cumbersome and often annoying thing to do. However, this can all be avoided if you have this Spotify Wrapped app installed!”

## II. User Stories and Backlog Presentation

The project backlog for a feature-rich Spotify Wrapped experience focuses on enhancing user interaction, social sharing, and personalized content. Prioritization balances immediate user value with longer-term vision.

**Intended user stories (first sprint in bold):**

- **[BASE] User Story #1:** As a user, I want to view different aspects of my personal Spotify listening tastes displayed in colorful and fun ways.  
- **[BASE]** As a user, I want to create an account and log in so I can view my past Spotify Wrapped summaries.  
- **[3] 1a** As a user, I want to grant my friends the ability to view my Spotify Wrapped.  
- **[13] 2a** As a user, I want to invite a friend to a **Duo Wrapped** that compares both of our tastes in a creative way.  
- **[8] 3a** As a user, I want an **LLM API** to dynamically describe how someone with my music tastes tends to act/think/dress during my Wrapped.  
- **[13] 5a** As a user, I want to hear clips from some of my top songs during my Wrapped *(requires at least one teammate with Spotify Premium due to API limits).*  
- **[8] 12a** As a user, I want to sign into my account from any device *(use Firebase cloud storage instead of SQLite).*  
- **[8] 9a** As a user, I want a page to post my Spotify Wrapped and see all public Wraps from other users.  
- **[13] 9c** Add ability to **comment** on and **like** Wraps, plus a filter to show only posts I’ve liked/commented on.
